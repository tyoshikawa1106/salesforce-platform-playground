# UI Bundle Features

## Installing Pre-built Features

Always check for an existing feature before building something from scratch. The features CLI installs pre-built, tested packages into Salesforce UI bundles — from foundational UI libraries (shadcn/ui) to full-stack capabilities. Authentication and search are the most commonly used features today; run `list --verbose` for the full current catalog, since it can grow over time.

> **Ownership note:** Agentforce AI conversation clients and file-upload are owned by separate skills (`experience-ui-bundle-agentforce-client-generate`, `experience-ui-bundle-file-upload-generate`). If the catalog also lists an Agentforce or file-upload entry, do not install it from both places — confirm with the user which delivery path they want, and never install the same capability twice in one bundle.

> **Package name:** `@salesforce/ui-bundle-features` is the canonical package name. Some older templates/samples still reference the deprecated `@salesforce/ui-bundle-features-experimental` name — never use the `-experimental` suffix. If a command fails to resolve, confirm the published version with `npm view @salesforce/ui-bundle-features version` before assuming the package name is wrong.

### Workflow

0. **Confirm this is a React UI bundle** — this CLI copies into `src/features/` and expects `npm run build` to work. Non-React bundles are not supported and will fail late in the install.

   Run `scripts/verify-react-bundle.sh`. If it exits non-zero, stop — the bundle is not React-based and this skill cannot proceed.

1. **Search project code first** — check `src/` for existing implementations before installing anything. Scope searches to `src/` to avoid matching `node_modules/` or `dist/`.

2. **Search available features** — use `npx @salesforce/ui-bundle-features list` with `--search <query>` to filter by keyword. Use `--verbose` for full descriptions.

3. **Describe a feature** — use `npx @salesforce/ui-bundle-features describe <feature>` to see components, dependencies, copy operations, and example files.

4. **Install** — use `npx @salesforce/ui-bundle-features install <feature> --ui-bundle-dir <name>`. Key options:
   - `--dry-run` to preview changes
   - `--yes` for non-interactive mode (skips conflicts)
   - `--on-conflict error` to detect conflicts, then `--conflict-resolution <file>` to resolve them

   Install features **before** doing custom frontend/layout work in this bundle — features may rewrite `appLayout.tsx`/`routes.tsx`, and installing after hand-built layout changes risks collisions.

If no matching feature is found, ask the user before building a custom implementation — a relevant feature may exist under a different name.

### Conflict Handling

In non-interactive environments, use the two-pass approach:

1. Run install with `--on-conflict error` to detect conflicts without applying them.
2. Before writing the resolution file, read `references/conflict-resolution-schema.json` for the allowed keys and enum values.
3. Write a resolution file at `<ui-bundle-dir>/conflict-resolution.json` (path is relative to the UI bundle directory being installed into, not the repo root). Key it by the exact paths the CLI printed as conflicts in pass 1, verbatim:
   ```json
   {
     "src/appLayout.tsx": "overwrite",
     "src/routes.tsx": "skip"
   }
   ```
   Any conflicting path *not* listed in this file defaults to `skip` — the CLI will not overwrite a file you didn't explicitly mark `overwrite`.
4. Re-run install with `--conflict-resolution <path-to-that-file>`.

### Post-install: Integrating Example Files

Features may include example files under an `__examples__/` directory (plural) showing integration patterns. These are often full, working pages with concrete names (e.g. `AccountSearch.tsx`), not bare placeholder templates. For each:

1. Read the example file to understand the pattern — treat it as a working reference implementation, not necessarily a stub.
2. Read the target file (shown in `describe` output).
3. Apply the pattern from the example into the target.
4. **CRITICAL — verify before deleting:**
   ```bash
   # Verify the build passes with the integrated pattern
   npm run build || {
     echo "ERROR: Build failed after integration - do NOT delete __examples__/"
     exit 1
   }
   
   # Verify the pattern from the example is actually present in the target
   # (adjust grep pattern to match a key symbol/import/component from the example)
   # Example: for SearchInput pattern integrated into AccountSearch.tsx
   grep -q "SearchInput\|useSearch" src/pages/*.tsx src/components/*.tsx 2>/dev/null || {
     echo "ERROR: Pattern from example not found in target files - integration incomplete"
     echo "Do NOT delete __examples__/ until the pattern is confirmed present"
     exit 1
   }
   
   # Only delete after both checks pass
   rm -rf __examples__/
   ```

If either check fails, **do NOT delete `__examples__/`** — the integration is incomplete. Fix the integration first, then re-run the verification.

### Hint Placeholders

Some copy paths use `<descriptive-name>` placeholders (e.g., `<desired-page-with-search-input>`) that the CLI does not resolve. After installation, rename or relocate these files to the intended target, or integrate their patterns into an existing file. This is separate from the `__examples__/` convention above — a single copy path can use either mechanism.

### Auth Feature: Org-Side Prerequisites

Installing the authentication feature only copies files — it does not configure the org. Before telling the user auth is done, flag that these org-side steps still need to happen (outside this skill's scope, but required for the feature to actually work):

- Digital Experiences (Experience Cloud) must be enabled, with Customer Community / Customer Community Plus licenses assigned to the relevant users, and Salesforce Sites enabled.
- The community and guest profiles need explicit Apex class access granted for the auth utility, login/registration, and password-reset classes — the CLI does not grant this automatically.
- Guest-profile sharing rules / org-wide defaults for any objects the auth flow touches.
- **Known limitation:** logout has a documented CSRF-handling gap (tracked as W-21253864) — call this out to the user rather than presenting logout as fully solved.

### CRITICAL: Resolve `<sfdxRoot>` After Every Install

The CLI may copy files under a literal `<sfdxRoot>` folder — an unresolved placeholder for this project's Salesforce DX metadata root (from `sfdx-project.json`'s `packageDirectories[].path`, e.g. `force-app/main/default`). Files left there are undeployable.

**After every install:**
```bash
find uiBundles/<AppName> -type d -regex '.*/<[^/]+>$'
```
If found, move each file to `<metadata-root>/<same-relative-subpath>` (keep `-meta.xml` sidecars attached) and delete the emptied placeholder dir(s).

**Verification:**
- [ ] Re-run `find uiBundles/<AppName> -type d -regex '.*/<[^/]+>$'` — output must be empty before proceeding.
