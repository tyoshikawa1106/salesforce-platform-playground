# Org Expiration Check

Determine when a Salesforce org expires, how many days remain, and whether it
has already expired — for one org, the default org, or every authenticated org.
Results are **prioritized** (already-expired and soonest-expiring first) with a
one-line summary. The skill can also emit machine-readable output for alerting,
print **backup** commands for an at-risk org, and explain how to **renew** an
expiring trial or Developer Edition org.

## When to use

Trigger on requests like:

- "When does my trial org expire?" / "Is it still active or has it expired?"
- "How many days are left on my trial?"
- "Which of my orgs are expiring soon?" / "expiring within 30 days?"
- "Alert me / set up a cron job for expiring orgs" (use `--json` + `--fail-if-expiring`).
- "Back up my org before it expires" (use `--preserve`).
- "How do I extend / renew my trial (or Developer Edition) org?" (use `--renew`).

This skill covers **trial editions, Developer Edition orgs** (anything with a
`TrialExpirationDate`), and **scratch orgs** (via the `expirationDate` from
`sf org list`).

## When NOT to use

Do **not** trigger this skill for:

- **Sandbox refresh timing** — that is not an expiration date.
- **Creating, deleting, or switching orgs** — this skill only *reads*
  expiration and *prints* guidance; it never creates, deletes, refreshes, or
  changes the active/default org. (To switch the default org, use
  `dx-org-switch`.)
- **Non-Salesforce trials** — e.g. AWS free tier, Netflix, or any other
  vendor's trial. This skill is Salesforce-only.

## How expiration is determined

- **Trial / Developer Edition orgs:** the authoritative source is the org's
  `Organization.TrialExpirationDate` field, read via SOQL (`sf data query`).
  This field is `null` for paid/production orgs, which therefore report **no
  trial expiration** — that is expected, not an error.
- **Scratch orgs:** the `expirationDate` reported by `sf org list` (no SOQL
  query is issued for scratch orgs).

## Steps

1. **CRITICAL:** Run the bundled helper script, which handles date math (days
   remaining, expired, expiring-soon warnings), prioritized sorting, and
   structured output, and works on macOS and Linux. Always invoke it by
   **absolute path** from the skill directory — never `./scripts/`, which
   resolves against the user's current directory and will either run the wrong
   script or fail.

   **Before executing, verify:**
   - [ ] `<skill_dir>` is an absolute path (starts with `/`), not a relative path
   - [ ] The path points at this skill's own directory (the one containing this SKILL.md)

   ```bash
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh" <alias-or-username>   # one org
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh"                       # default org (target-org config)
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh" --all                 # every authenticated org
   bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh" --all --within 30     # only orgs expiring within 30 days
   ```

   `<skill_dir>` is the absolute path to the directory containing this SKILL.md.

2. Relay the script output to the user. When an org could not be queried,
   surface the `sf org login web` command the script prints so the user can
   authenticate. Pick optional flags based on what the user asked for (see
   below): `--preserve` when they want to save their work, `--renew` when they
   ask how to extend, `--json`/`--csv` for automation, `--fail-if-expiring`
   for a cron/CI gate.

## Options

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--all`, `-a` | Check every authenticated org. |
| `--within <days>`, `-w` | Show only orgs expiring within N days (includes already-expired; omits paid/production). `--within=30` also works. |
| `--json` | Emit a JSON array of org records (data only). |
| `--csv` | Emit CSV rows (data only). |
| `--preserve` | Print backup commands for expiring/expired orgs. |
| `--renew` | Print trial/DE extension & reactivation guidance. |
| `--fail-if-expiring[=N]` | Exit 3 if any org expires within N days (default 7). |
| `--no-scratch` | Exclude scratch orgs (trial/DE only). |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show usage. |

Flag order is flexible and flags combine (e.g. `--all --within 30 --json`).

## Prioritized output

Human output is grouped by urgency — **Expired** first, then **Expiring soon**
(within 7 days, flagged `Warning`), then **Active**, then **No trial expiration**,
then any orgs that could not be queried — and ends with a one-line summary:

```text
Org expiration status for all authenticated orgs:

Expired:
  old-trial                       trial/DE edition expired 2026-06-20  (EXPIRED 19 day(s) ago)

Expiring soon (within 7 day(s)):
  almost-up                       trial/DE edition expires 2026-07-14  (expires in 5 day(s)  Warning)

Active (not expiring soon):
  acme-trial                      trial/DE edition expires 2026-08-15  (expires in 37 day(s))
  my-scratch                      scratch org expires 2026-07-25  (expires in 16 day(s))

No trial expiration (paid/production):
  prod                            no trial expiration (paid/production org)

Summary: 1 expired, 1 expiring within 7 day(s), 2 active, 1 with no expiration.
```

## Structured output for alerting and cron (`--json` / `--csv`)

For dashboards, spreadsheets, or scheduled jobs, use `--json` or `--csv` to get
machine-readable records (no prose). Each record has `org`, `kind`,
`expirationDate`, `daysRemaining` (negative = expired, `null` = no expiration),
`status`, and `orgId`. This is deterministic and needs no LLM in the loop.

```bash
# JSON, filtered to orgs expiring within 30 days:
bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh" --all --within 30 --json
```

**Cron watchdog** — `--fail-if-expiring[=N]` exits `3` (and prints an `ALERT:`
line to stderr) if any org expires within N days (default 7), so a scheduled
job can page you before an org lapses:

```bash
# crontab: every morning at 9, alert if anything expires within 7 days
0 9 * * *  bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh" --all --fail-if-expiring 7 \
             || mail -s "Salesforce org expiring soon" me@example.com
```

## Preserve your work before an org lapses (`--preserve`)

When an org expires you lose access to its metadata and data. `--preserve`
prints ready-to-run backup commands (metadata manifest + `retrieve`, and a bulk
data export) for each expiring or already-expired org. It only *prints* the
commands — review and run them yourself:

```bash
bash "<skill_dir>/scripts/check_expiration.sh" my-trial --preserve
```

## Extend or renew a trial / Developer Edition org (`--renew`)

`--renew` prints the current guidance for keeping an org alive, and surfaces the
Org IDs of at-risk orgs so the steps are actionable:

- **Partners:** request a Trial Org extension (up to +12 months) via
  `partners.salesforce.com` → **Ask Agentforce** → "I want to extend my Trial
  Org", providing the Org ID. Eligible while active or expired < 30 days; not
  for LDV orgs. (Salesforce Help article 000387818.)
- **Nonprofits:** email your Account Executive with subject "Trial Extension"
  and the trial-starter email, Org ID, and username; AMER
  `PowerOfUsDesk@salesforce.com`, other regions `myaccount@salesforce.com` /
  1-800-NO-SOFTWARE. Works even if already expired. (Article 004754220.)
- **Developer Edition:** DE orgs have no subscription clock but are deactivated
  after prolonged inactivity (~180 days without a login); log in periodically.
  If locked (not yet deleted), open a Salesforce Customer Support case to
  reactivate — once permanently deleted, an org cannot be recovered.
- To keep a standard trial's data/config, convert/subscribe to a paid edition
  before it lapses.

## Exit codes

- `0` success
- `1` an org could not be queried (auth/connection error)
- `2` bad usage or a missing dependency (`sf` or `jq`)
- `3` `--fail-if-expiring` threshold breached (at least one org expiring)

When both apply, a `--fail-if-expiring` breach (`3`) takes precedence over an
auth error (`1`): the alerting signal wins so a watchdog still fires. If your
job must also detect unreachable orgs, run `--json` and inspect the records for
`status: "auth_error"` in addition to checking the exit code. Note that an org
whose credentials fail cannot be date-checked, so it never counts toward a
`--fail-if-expiring` breach on its own.

`--fail-if-expiring` with no explicit number treats a following **all-numeric**
argument as the day count (e.g. `--fail-if-expiring 12345`). In the rare case an
org's alias is purely numeric, pass the org first (`check_expiration.sh 12345
--fail-if-expiring 7`) so it isn't mistaken for the threshold.

## Authentication

If an org isn't authenticated (no saved credentials, or an expired/revoked
token), the script does not fail silently — it prints the exact command to log
in and then re-run:

```text
  my-trial                       not authenticated — no saved credentials for this org

  To authenticate, run one of:
    sf org login web --alias "my-trial"
    sf org login web --alias <my-alias> --instance-url https://test.salesforce.com
  Then re-run this check. List existing logins with:  sf org list
```

`sf org login web` opens a browser to complete the OAuth flow. Use
`--instance-url https://test.salesforce.com` for sandboxes, or a custom My
Domain URL where applicable.

## Manual fallback (if the script is unavailable)

```bash
# Trial/DE expiration for one org (null = not a trial / paid org):
sf data query --query "SELECT Id, TrialExpirationDate FROM Organization" --target-org <org> --json

# Scratch org expiration comes from the org list, not SOQL:
sf org list --json
```

## Notes

- Requires the Salesforce CLI (`sf`) and `jq` on the PATH, plus at least one
  authenticated org (`sf org login web`).
- Avoid launching many `sf` commands concurrently — the CLI can be slow under
  contention. The script queries orgs sequentially for this reason.
- `sf org list` exposes a `trailExpirationDate` (note the typo) field that is
  often `null`; the script does not rely on it for trial/DE orgs — it uses the
  SOQL `TrialExpirationDate`, which is reliable. It does use `expirationDate`
  from the list for scratch orgs.
